- **19/04/2021:** We have updated the grading section, please scroll down for further details.

### Logistics

**Lecturer:** Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†

**Assistants:** Dr. Luca Moschella, Dr. Antonio Norelli

**When:** Wednesdays 09:00--12:00 and Thursdays 17:00--19:00 ([official schedule](https://www.studiareinformatica.uniroma1.it/laurea-magistrale/orario-lezioni))

**Where:**

- Physically: Aula 1 - Aule L Via del Castro Laurenziano 7a

*Important*: Please use **Infostud Lab** (not Prodigit!) for booking a seat in the classroom. This should be done **no later than 48h** from the start of the lecture.

- Virtually: Zoom ([link to the virtual classroom](https://zoom.us/j/4752349941?pwd=U0doeGFLWFFDSWlzWWxvd0JGMDRndz09)), Meeting ID: 475 234 9941, Passcode: 3K7xrM.

**Q & A:** Please use the issue system of Github. [Here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2021) is the link to the course repository, you'll need to create a free account to access it.

### Pre-requisites

Programming fundamentals in **Python**; calculus; linear algebra.

### Textbook and reading material

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

### Grading

Evaluation proceeds according to the following steps:

- A midterm self-evaluation test (optional, does not concur to the final grade)
- A final written exam (**mandatory**, accounts for 60% of the final grade)
- A project (**mandatory**, accounts for 40% of the final grade)
- An oral exam (optional, attributes at most 3 points, added to or subtracted from the final grade)

The _cum laude_ can be obtained only by taking the oral exam. For students who already have a very high score with written exam + project, the oral exam is meant to confirm the high score.

The list of **projects** will be published soon. Each project must be accompanied with code to a github repository, and with a 2 page report using a fixed template we will provide. Projects can be made in groups of at most 2 students.

### Lectures

All the lectures (video, audio and chat script) will be recorded and stored in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ByxH8071EwBJkkRpb1NpkyIG7MM3psHl?usp=sharing).

Please note that the audio quality will not be very good in general, due to technical issues.
